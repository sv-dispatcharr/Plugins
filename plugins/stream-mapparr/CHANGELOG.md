# Stream-Mapparr CHANGELOG

## v0.9.0 (April 4, 2026)
**Type**: Performance & UI Enhancement Release

### Performance Optimizations (ported from Linearr plugin)

**Levenshtein Acceleration**:
- Uses `rapidfuzz` C extension when available (20-50x faster)
- Pure Python fallback with early termination via new `threshold` parameter
- Combined effect: matching 94 channels x 3,362 streams in ~2s (was ~5 minutes)

**Normalization Cache**:
- Added `precompute_normalizations()` to cache stream name normalization once before matching loops
- `fuzzy_match()` and `find_best_match()` use cached results via `_get_cached_norm()` / `_get_cached_processed()`
- Eliminates redundant `normalize_name()` calls across all 3 matching stages
- Cache fallback uses stored ignore flags for consistency

**ETA Calculation**:
- Updated `ESTIMATED_SECONDS_PER_ITEM` from 7.73s to 0.1s to reflect actual performance

### UI Simplification

**Profile Name**: Free-text input replaced with dynamic dropdown populated from database

**Match Sensitivity**: Numeric threshold (0-100) replaced with named presets:
- Relaxed (70), Normal (80), Strict (90), Exact (95)

**Tag Handling**: Four separate boolean toggles consolidated into single dropdown:
- Strip All Tags (default), Keep Regional Tags, Keep All Tags

**Channel Database**: Per-country boolean toggles consolidated into single dropdown:
- None, individual country, or All databases

All changes are backward compatible — legacy field IDs still work as fallbacks.

### Files Modified
- `fuzzy_matcher.py` v26.095.0100: Cache system, rapidfuzz support, early termination
- `plugin.py` v0.9.0: Precompute calls, UI fields, settings resolvers
- `plugin.json` v0.9.0: Updated field definitions

### Version Compatibility
| Plugin Version | Required fuzzy_matcher |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 0.9.0 | 26.095.0100+ |
| 0.8.0b | 26.018.0100+ |
| 0.7.4a | 26.018.0100+ |

## v0.8.0b (March 11, 2026)
**Type**: Bugfix Release
**Severity**: HIGH (ORM Migration)

### Bug Fixed: Invalid `group_title` Field on Stream Model

**Issue**: After migrating from HTTP API to Django ORM in v0.8.0a, the plugin used `group_title` as a field name on the Stream model. This field does not exist — the correct field is `channel_group` (a ForeignKey to `ChannelGroup`). Any action that loads streams (Add Streams, Preview Changes, Load/Process Channels) would fail with:
```
Cannot resolve keyword 'group_title' into field.
```

**Root Cause**: During the ORM migration, the old API response field name `group_title` was carried over into ORM `.values()` queries, but the Django model uses `channel_group` (FK) instead.

**Fix**: Replaced `group_title` with `channel_group__name` (Django FK traversal) in two locations:
- `_get_all_streams()`: Stream data query
- `_get_stream_groups()`: Distinct stream group name query

**Files Modified**:
- `plugin.py` v0.8.0b: Fixed ORM field references
- `plugin.json` v0.8.0b: Version bump

## v0.7.4a (January 18, 2026)
**Type**: Critical Bugfix Release
**Severity**: HIGH (Stream Matching)

### Bug Fixed: 4K/8K Quality Tags Not Removed During Normalization

**Issue**: Streams with "4K" or "8K" quality suffixes were not matching correctly because the space normalization step was splitting "4K" into "4 K" before quality patterns could remove it.

**Example**:
- Stream: `┃NL┃ RTL 4 4K`
- Expected: Tag removed → "RTL 4" → matches channel
- Actual: "4K" split to "4 K" → patterns fail → "RTL 4 4 K" → no match

**Root Cause**: The digit-to-letter space normalization (`re.sub(r'(\d)([a-zA-Z])', r'\1 \2', name)`) transformed "4K" into "4 K" before quality patterns could match and remove "4K".

**Pattern Observed**:
| Quality Suffix | Affected? | Reason |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| HD, SD, FHD, UHD | No | All letters, not split |
| 4K, 8K | **Yes** | Digit+letter split to "4 K", "8 K" |

**Fix**: Quality patterns are now applied BEFORE space normalization to prevent "4K"/"8K" from being broken.

**Files Modified**:
- `fuzzy_matcher.py` v26.018.0100: Moved quality pattern removal before space normalization
- `plugin.py` v0.7.4a: Updated version and minimum fuzzy_matcher requirement

## v0.7.3c (December 23, 2025)
**Type**: Critical Bugfix Release
**Severity**: HIGH (Unicode tag users)

### Bug Fixed: Custom Ignore Tags with Unicode Characters Not Working

**Issue**: Custom ignore tags containing Unicode or special characters (like `┃NLZIET┃`) were completely ignored during normalization, causing all channels to fail matching.

**Root Cause**: Code used regex word boundaries (`\b`) for all custom tags. Word boundaries only work with alphanumeric characters. Unicode characters like `┃` (U+2503) are not word characters.

**Fix**: Smart tag detection - only use word boundaries for pure alphanumeric tags, use literal matching for Unicode/special character tags.

## v0.7.4 (December 22, 2025)
**Type**: Critical Bugfix Release
**Severity**: HIGH (Matching Accuracy)

### Bug #1 Fixed: Substring Matching Too Permissive

**Issue**: "Story" matched "HISTORY" at threshold 80 because substring matching didn't validate semantic similarity.

**Fix**: Added 75% length ratio requirement for substring matches.

### Bug #2 Fixed: Regional Tags Stripped Despite Setting

**Issue**: `Ignore Regional Tags: False` didn't work - "(WEST)" was still being removed by MISC_PATTERNS and callsign patterns.

**Fix**: Conditional MISC_PATTERNS application and callsign pattern with negative lookahead for regional indicators.

---

## v0.7.3 (December 21, 2025)
**Type**: Enhancement Release

### Added FuzzyMatcher Version to CSV Headers

CSV exports now show both plugin and fuzzy_matcher versions for better troubleshooting:
```csv
# Stream-Mapparr Export v0.7.3
# FuzzyMatcher Version: 25.354.1835
```

---

## v0.7.2 (December 20, 2025)
**Type**: Bugfix Release

### Fixed: Incomplete Regional Patterns

Updated fuzzy_matcher dependency to include all 6 US timezone regional indicators (East, West, Pacific, Central, Mountain, Atlantic) instead of just "East".

## Upgrade Instructions

2. Replace `fuzzy_matcher.py` with v26.018.0100
3. Restart Dispatcharr container
4. Re-run "Match & Assign Streams"

**IMPORTANT**: Both files must be updated together!
